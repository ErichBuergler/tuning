                    The meeting place is usually a car park near a city. 
                    Often on Sundays near the surrounding recreation areas. 
                    These are the so-called car posers who admire each other's glossy polished cars. 
                    There, these drivers let the extra-amplified engines roar and the car tyres squeal. 
                    The principle is: the louder, the more powerful.

                    </p> 
                    This often causes distress among neighbours. In response to such meetings, the police are increasingly
                     carrying out checks. The law enforcers hand out fines for "avoidable noise" or modifications to the muscle cars that 
                     do not comply with the regulations.

                     But who drives such pimped cars? An analysis of data from the Federal Roads Office (Astra) shows a clear picture for Switzerland
                      when it comes to gender distribution. It is primarily men who flex the muscles of their cars. While the proportion of women among the 
                     4.7 million passenger cars registered in Switzerland is 33 percent, the share of women in tuned cars is only 20 percent. 
                    The proportion of male drivers of pimped cars is 65 percent.

                <p> <h3>Business people appreciate fast cars</h3>
                    
                    But it is not only private individuals who appreciate fast cars.
                     According to the official entries, a disproportionately large number of tuned
                      business cars drive on Swiss roads. Car tuning is not limited to used cars.
                       New vehicles can also be bought from special suppliers with boosted engines.
                        Apparently, many business people find this necessary to meet their schedules.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        
                    </div>


                </p>
                In the analysis, only cars with boosted engines could be counted as tuned cars based on the available data.
                 Their share is only 0.5 percent. However, the actual figure is most likely higher.
                  As the police controls show, many owners do not have their tuned engines officially registered.
                   Although this would be required by law. 
                </p>

                In the tuning scene there are numerous different types of extra enhanced engines. Stock-looking cars with performance upgrades are called “Sleeper”.
                 Why sleeper? Not everyone enjoys the spotlight, explains the online tuning-guide “low offset”:
                  “Some of us car enthusiasts like being a wolf in sheep’s clothing; behind the wheel of an unassuming stealth bomber that conveniently flies
                  under the radar when you want it to.” But there are also “drift cars”, where the brakes, throttle and steering are manipulated in such a way to keep the car in an oversteer position. This gets you “the sounds of crazy accelerations”, according to another tuning-website.

                    And where are the most muscle cars on Swiss roads? An analysis by municipality, with more than 2000 registered vehicles,
                     shows a clear picture: the canton of Zurich is the car pimping hotspot in terms of the percentage of tuned vehicles.
                      The five municipalities with the highest percentage of muscle cars  - more than twice as many as the average in Switzerland - are not far apart. The Zurich cliché that
                      souped up cars are a preference of the people of Aargau is thus disproved - at least in part.
                        The five localities are close to the border with the canton of Aargau.
